        Hello! I'm Teazon, a college student who loves to play and develop video games in their free time. TeaZone is a website that I've made to put out reviews on the games I've played, and simultaneously help to improve my writing skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hopefully, one of my game reviews will help out other fellow gamers out there and give them brand-new perspectives through my hopefully insightful writing. I'm also planning many things for this website, like giving out updates on my own games that I've been working on. But for now, game reviews are only what this website has to offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Check out my other social media accounts in the Bio page if you wanna know more about me and see my game projects that I have worked on and working on currently!
